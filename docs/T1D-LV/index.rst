T1D_LV_analysis
======================================

The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of T1D, and the heterogeneity of T1D progression from the perspective of gene modules.

About the project
=================
T1D is an autoimmune disease that progresses through three stages. The earliest phase, preceding stage 1, is known as Islet Autoimmunity (IA), when at least one of the four autoantibodies associated with beta-cell damage is detected. The time it takes to progress from IA to symptomatic T1D varies greatly between individuals. Exploring the genetic underlying of T1D constitues an important step in understanding the mechanism at play at each stage above. However not only does T1D involve a mix of genetic and environmental factors, but its genetic component is also highly complex due to its pleiotropic nature. Therefore, we use Phenoplier to understand how genes work together throughout the disease progression. Phenoplier uses large public data to create latent variables representing genes that are co-expressed in various diseases, conditions, or cell type. In the first part of this project, we use Phenoplier to identify gene modules involved in T1D.
